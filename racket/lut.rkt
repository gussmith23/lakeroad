;;; The output of a LUT is simply the bit at the entry pointed to by `inputs-a`, when interpreted as
;;; an integer. It's probably worth putting this somewhere more generally usable. LUTs must return
;;; only one bit.

;;; TODO(@gussmith23): figure out how to return multiple bits while still using theory of bitvectors
;;; only. The old solution used theory of integers to index into the bitvector.
