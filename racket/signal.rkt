;;; TODO(@gussmith): We rely heavily on hash tables for this implementation. Hash tables are not
;;; lifted in Rosette, and thus we have to be very careful with them. In general, I think these are
;;; the rules to obey when using hash tables in Rosette:
;;; - Only use immutable hash tables.
;;; - Keys should never be symbolic. They should always be concrete.

;;; Signals represent bitvectors with associated state.
;;;
;;; State is an association list from keywords to bitvectors. The entries in the state map are the
;;; various pieces of state that existed when the signal value was generated. For example, the output
;;; of a pipelined multiplier module might be an bitvector v. The signal representing the multiplier's
;;; output might then look like (signal v { internal-register-0: (bv #x0a 8), internal-register-1: (bv
;;; #x0b 8) }), where the internal registers represent some state internal to the multiplier module.
;;;
;;; - next: the next value of the signal. See #284. This is just a hack for now, and needs to be
;;;   fleshed out.
;;; - value: in the context of this new hack (#284), value is now the "previous" value.
