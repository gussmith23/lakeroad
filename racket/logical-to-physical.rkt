;;; Logical to physical (and vice versa) mapping tools for Lakeroad.
;;;
;;; A key component of Lakeroad is determining how *logical* signals (e.g. an 8 bit input) get wired
;;; to *physical* inputs, e.g. the 48 input bits of a Xilinx UltraScale+ Configurable Logic Block.
;;; This module provides tools for representing these mappings.

;;; Interprets logical-to-physical-input mapping.
;;;
;;; There are two variants.
;;;
;;; Both variants take an interpreter function, to interpret unrecognized expressions.
;;;
;;; The second argument is an expression, whose syntax is defined below:
;;;
;;; The first variant uses a Rosette uninterpreted function to represent
;;; the underlying logical-to-physical mapping. The second variant allows a Racket function to be used
;;; directly.
;;;
;;; The first variant takes arguments:
;;; bw: bitwidth of map indices.
;;; f: a Rosette function value (i.e. passes (fv? f)), symbolic or concrete.
;;; bits-per-group: Number of bits per physical input group.
;;;
;;; The second variant takes:
;;; f: a function taking a list of bitvectors and returning a list of bitvectors. the input list is
;;;    (logical input 0, logical input 1, ...). the returned list is (physical input 0, physical input
;;;    1, ...).
;;;
;;; Both variants take:
;;; inputs: list of logical input bitvectors: (logical input 0, logical input 1, ...). These are
;;; assumed to be the same bitwidth and be in MSB..LSB order.
;;;
;;; If neither of these variants are matched, then the expression is passed to the interpreter fn.
;;;
;;; Returns: list of physical input bitvectors: (physical input 0, physical input 1, ...).
