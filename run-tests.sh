# We could use the -j flag of raco test to run tests in parallel, but instead,
# we expect every test to parallelize itself if needed. We get more value out of
# parallelizing individual tests (like how we use make to parallelize Verilation
# in end-to-end builds), and multiple levels of parallelization would probably
# cause some thrashing.
#
# We also time the tests, as the Racket tests are the slowest part of the testing process.
